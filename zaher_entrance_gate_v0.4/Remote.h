    * dtostrf( float_or_double, total_number_of_chars_including_the_decimal_point , number_of_decimal_places, final_buffer_array_or_pointer ); 
    * As for the total_number_of_chars_including_the_decimal_point, it doesn't have to be increased by 1 to consider the final null char, and I
    * didn't increase it as it would write it to the right not to the left (a bit weird).
    * itoa( i, buffer, 10 );
    * 
    * The format is as follows :
    * humidity->(1 or more) trailors -> temperature -> 1 or more null chars
    * temperature is like -.- or --.- (from 0.0 to 99.9)
    * humidity is like --- (from 0 to 100)
    * 9->trailor->trailor->trailor->1->2->.->6->'\0'->... (no new trailors at the end. Just null chars)
