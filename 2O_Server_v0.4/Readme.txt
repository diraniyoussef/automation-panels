2O_Server_v0.4  - Arduino

--This version stems from "HumTemp_Loc_v0.3"
--This will interwork with eclipse intermediate code ""
--This interworks with Android App "DiversePanels_v0.6"

THIS IS A WORKING VERSION

***Details
-- same as before, but I added this variable const char* Panel_Type = "2O"; //either "2I", "2O", or "TempHum"
and automated in the code (not by user selection) whether this panel behaves as 2O or tempHum.
